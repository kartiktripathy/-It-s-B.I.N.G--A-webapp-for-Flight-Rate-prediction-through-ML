# "It's B.I.N.G" -A webapp for Flight Rate prediction through ML
This is a web app created with the help of Streamlit, which predicts the prices of flights by a regression ML model embedded in the backend.
The model is trained on a dataset that combines various features like the arrival, departure date and time, duration of the journey, Type of class in the flight, the operating company of the flight, etc.
It was trained using Random Forest Regression and the model functions with an accuracy of over 95%.
The frontend was developed by the Streamlit library of Python, which provides a quite fluid interface for the users.
The model can be used by the major customers for the prediction of flight prices prior to their journey.
